### Cybera Isaic Bridge the Gap Hackathon Project:
This project was originally started for the [Cybera Isaic Bridge the Gap Hackathon.](https://www.cybera.ca/connectivity-hackathon)The goal of the hackathon was to use available datasets to create a data product that would help identify communities, and possibly demographics in Alberta that are underserved in regards to internet accessibility. This particular project was not finished in time to be submitted.

### Original Presentation Requirements:
#### Inspiration:
Various geo-spatial projects found on kaggle and github. More specifically, the 4 winners of the competition, found [here.](https://wiki.cybera.ca/display/shareit/45613609/UOP67c4b31f095f4296a49eb018fa419368LVU)

#### What You Built:
This repo contains a set of notebooks, one for each of the hackathon goals stated, to identify communities underserved connectivity wise, and to assess the correlation between social and economic indicators.

#### How You Built it:
These notebooks were built using Python, Geopandas, Pandas, Folium, Matplotlib, and Sklearn in Jupyter Notebooks.

#### How it Works:

#### Impact:

#### Challenges:
- The library I wanted to use refused to work properly with certain parts of the reserve shapefile, I definitely got way too distracted to trying to get it to work, and trying to figure out why it wasn't working.

- accomplishments

#### Lessons You Learned:
- Scoping the problem out, and laying out how to approach it, is extremely important.
